# Enhancement Summary

1. **Research & Alignment** – Reviewed current repo/docs and existing /gotjob/ UI to understand navigation, filters, and issues; mapped industry standards (AI transparency, candidate experience, mobile focus) to craft new add-on stories.
2. **New Add-On Pages** – Added dedicated /ai-match-lab/, /experience-hub/, and /mobile-studio/ landing pages with hero CTAs, feature grids, and explanation of signals, transparency, and mobile-first controls; reused shared styles (.feature-hero, .feature-card, .cta-row) for consistent look.
3. **Navigation & Promotion** – Updated main / and /gotjob/ nav bars and featured cards to surface the new pages, ensuring the search flow links back to the add-ons via CTAs and additional resource cards.
4. **Documentation** – Expanded README.md so add-on pages are documented with bullet lists and navigation entries, making their purpose and links clear.
5. **Testing** – Executed scripts/playwright-test.mjs locally under escalated permissions; all six tests (home load, job cards, search, filters, /findjobs/, nav presence) passed.

These steps realize the plan: research-inspired add-on pages with linked CTAs, shared styling, and completion checks before planning deployment.
